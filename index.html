				<p>Oh, what an adventure I’ve had! I wish you were there with me to witness it yourself. But no worries,
					let
					me recap it briefly!
					<br>
					<br>
					Raised in the fairly small town of Bhopal, In 2012, I wound up my Senior Year at school with a 78.4%
					result. After excelling in my entrance exam, I was gratefully accepted to SRM University.
					Resultingly,
					the world started appearing a lot more culturally plural. There I learned a ton of coding, made some
					lifelong friends, received straight A’s in my projects, led teams for the largest student
					organization in the
					world - AIESEC, but most importantly graduated as the first engineer in the family!
					<br>
					<br>
					Employment followed shortly, at a Fortune 500 Company, Cognizant. I organized myself into being an
					employee, learned the tropes of the corporate industry, impressed my first global clients from
					Germany,
					delivering them their primary website. But in the interest of working on more bleeding edge
					technologies, I
					left my cushy job at Cognizant, to work for a 10 member educational startup named Peerbuds, a
					venture
					by San Francisco based Klouddata Inc. That’s when the adventure really started.
					<br>
					<br>
					After 10 months of platform development, we were all set to change the world's educational system.
					Meanwhile, Blockchain became the latest buzz and we decided to ride that wave. This radical
					shift in firms direction shrunk the team to 3 members, the CEO, CTO and me. Undeterred by the
					setbacks we rebranded ourselves into The Blockchain University (TBU) and I got promoted as the
					product lead.
					<br>
					<br>
					4 months into development, we 3 joined an accelerator, wrote a white paper, built a new
					blockchain-based protocol and used it to build our platform. It was at this time when I had my first
					taste
					of Owning a product, as I had to take up responsibilities in developing product strategy, building a
					tech community
					and instructing at blockchain workshops, all the while still leading the platform development. But,
					like
					all things good, TBU was nearing its end due to the profitless platform and plateauing growth. In
					early-2019, sensing TBU's impending doom, I switched to First Walkin Technologies (Walkin) as a
					Product Lead, hoping for a comparably stable gig, destiny, however, had different plans.
					<br>
					<br>
					6 months into the job, a major event happened, our Primary investor and biggest client passed away.
					This sent our firm into a frenzy, but this time I was committed not to let
					circumstances affect the organization, as now I had a voice at the table. Resultantly, my team was
					chosen to implement one of India's largest customer loyalty programs, for Dominos and we delivered.
					As a result, this multi-million dollar contract pulled the firm out of the red. Currently, I lead
					the team
					developing our SaaS-based experience management platform, at present our firm's most sought-after
					product.
					<br>
					<br>
					Today, I've become adept at building impeccable products at large scale and constantly getting
					better.</p>

				<h2 class="major">25 Random Things About Me</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<ol>
					<li>
						I can be considered a computer nerd, as I can build anything digital, Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps,
						Websites,  Browser extensions, etc. As long as it can be coded I can build it. And that’s
						exactly what I’ve been doing for a  living. I also have a GitHub repository with numerous
						projects. And the best part is I derive fun building these  projects. 
					</li>
					<li>
						As Step aside from my professional responsibilities, I have also instructed hundreds of people
						on how to build  apps on Blockchain, without charge, in our meetups, the Open Distributed Labs
						in Bengaluru. Helping members  create cryptocurrencies and other cool projects
					</li>
					<li>
						Professionally, the most gratifying moment of my career would be when I spearheaded the
						engineering team  implementing a customer loyalty program for Dominos, making it one of India’s
						largest loyalty programs with  70M+ members, this also helped my firm secure a multi-million
						dollar deal with the franchise. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I also created a SaaS-based customer feedback management system and although I don’t want to
						create the  impression that I’m a pizza connoisseur, coincidentally among other clients it is
						also used by Pizza hut and Cafe  Coffee Day in India, which combinedly process 50,000+
						transactions every day!
					</li>
					<li>
						In 2018, the 3 person startup where I worked as a product lead, got selected by an accelerator,
						JioGenNext,  conceived by Mr. Mukesh Ambani and those 2 months were momentous in shaping my
						outlook towards  Entrepreneurship. Living and working with some of the best minds in the country
						trying to solve problems I had  never thought of, especially in the massive shifting tides of
						the educational sector
					</li>
					<li>
						Cofounders of one of my previous firm once touted a non-existent product feature to an investor,
						so I worked  overnight at a stretch for 12 hours, then slept in the morning. after deploying the
						new feature. My cofounders then  went ahead and successfully pitched the feature to the
						investors, while I was still sleeping. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I worked as the product lead in a 3 member startup with ambitions to change the education and
						certification  industry using blockchain. Apart from developing the platform, I even contributed
						to developing a protocol and  writing a white paper, but we were probably a little ahead of the
						time, and although we were just an educational  platform, we were still bought down by
						restrictions imposed by the Indian Reserve Bank. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In 2019 April, I helped an abandoned and dazed old woman, whom I saw on the footpath on my way
						to work, for a  week. Over the days I contacted the relevant authorities to help her and one
						accepted to pick her up. After having  a conversation with the lady they took her to a hospital
						and rehabilitated her, they then contacted me and told me  she’s being moved to an old age home
						and is being taken care of. Every day while commuting to work when I see  the now-empty place
						where she once used to sit, I feel happy that I could help her but I also feel sad that there
						are  many more I’m unable to. It also motivates me to do think for the greater good of society.
					</li>
					<li>
						I’m a born tinkerer, even today I experiment around with technology, for example: Instead of
						buying a chromecast,  I resurrected my old laptop, installed Android OS in it and connected it
						to my TV, effectively saving myself some  money and giving the retired laptop a new purpose in
						life. 
					</li>
					<li>
						When I joined my undergraduate college, I was very timid and reclusive, but then I joined the
						Chennai chapter of  the world’s largest student organization AIESEC. In my Sophomore year, I led
						the team for marketing for AIESEC in  Chennai. This made me much bolder and garrulous. It was
						one of the best decisions I ever took. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In my freshman year, I was a delegate to the Youth to Business Forum, I was the first time I
						attended a forum  focused on leadership and business. Before this, I only focused on technology,
						but after this, for the first time, I  realized the importance business plays in bringing
						innovations to people. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I get the majority of my daily updates and entertainment from Youtube. I have an everyday ritual
						where I go  through my subscriptions and add the videos to my watch later, then I watch these
						videos over the rest of the day  whenever I get time. This keeps me updated with what’s going on
						in the world in all fields of my interest such as  Technology, World and National News,
						Entertainment, etc. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I love mixing music, so much so that while I was in college I took a year-long certificate
						course in DJing. Even  today I listen to almost all genres of music and when I’m not working I
						sometimes play at a few nearby venues, as  a DJ. I’m really proud of this hobby of mine. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In my Freshman year, I once taught underprivileged children in a village nearby to my college,
						as part of a  community outreach program. That day I was so happy and full of energy, as these
						children showed so much  enthusiasm in asking me questions in science and technology and I
						reciprocated with equal enthusiasm, making  sure all their queries are answered. This experience
						taught me how important it is to give back to society and it  essentially changed the way I used
						to look at the world. It made me rethink my priorities in life. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I’m generally fitness conscious, although I only workout for an hour at my home every day, I
						prefer going out for  group sports and activities, like soccer, boxing, etc. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Although I knew it would be painful, inconvenient, and full of restrictions, I still got dental
						braces while I was 23.  This experience taught me patience, commitment, and tolerance like
						nothing else before. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I have a knack for playing massively multiplayer online pc games with my friends. As we get a
						platform to create  and execute strategies and play with teamwork, all while having loads of
						fun. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I am an avid competitive programmer, have received multiple badges in Hackerrank. This doesn’t
						only improve my  coding skills, but it also challenges my quantitative and analytical abilities.
						Thus keeping me sharp. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In my sophomore year, created multiple videos for many events in college. I learned editing
						videos and creating  special effects, from youtube, using professional tools such as Adobe After
						Effects and Premiere Pro. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In my freshman year of college, I built and programmed an autonomous robot capable of running on
						solar power,  although I did this with the assistance of a few of the university professors in a
						workshop, It was my first foray  into programming physical things. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I like going for hiking and treks to nearby mountains during weekends, It helps me hit the reset
						switch on the  otherwise mundane life. It also gives me some time to reflect on things and
						sometimes I even end up meeting  very interesting people. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I learned basic hacking in an 8-hour security testing workshop conducted during my undergrad. I
						may not be an  expert hacker like the ones shown in pop culture, but I have a very deep
						understanding of privacy and internet  security. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I generally cook for myself and I can make some very mean Indian delicacies. With Butter
						chicken being one of my  best dishes. Cooking also helps me clear out my mind as well as
						precisely control what goes into my body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Although I’m 25, I track all my expenses on a gamified app called fortune city, where I build a
						city as I track my  expenses. It adds some fun to managing my accounts while giving me detailed
						analytics on my expenditure. 
					</li>
					<li>
						My life’s goal is to eradicate poverty and helplessness. I plan to do this by developing an
						organization that is  completely self-sustainable, and rehabilitates, educates, employs and
						shelters everyone who’s in need. 
					</li>
